<h3>After you download .src file you should compile replace.cpp and invoke it on downloaded file to replace commas (set FROM = ',') with dots (set TO = '.')</h3>
<h3>After that you need to compile and run shift_captions.cpp on received file</h3>
<h3>To finish you 'shifting' invoke replace.cpp again but with (FROM = '.' TO = ',')</h3>
